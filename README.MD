# Superpy User Guide
Second draft of superpy

When making Superpy I was a bit clueless and lost in the beginning but after searching up some youtube tutorials and using my previous experience with Python I got to work. It took some time since I work besides this but eventually I started making a lot of progress.
I personally do not see the use of argparse since I believe a while loop is more user friendly but thats probably because I do not have much experience and haven't worked with massive files. In the end I figured out how argparse worked and applied it to my code.
The code is not 100% optimized but I am happy with how it is now. The main.py file is 335 lines long and I could have probably split it up to make the code look more organized like make a sell.py file and just import from there but I kind of like having everything in 1 place.

The README.md and the .giticore files should not be uploaded and are not part of my code.

The commands below can be used in the terminal to get results. If there is nothing mentioned after the command (like --display) it means that there are no arguments necessary. Some commands, like --buy. Will require user input after entering in the command. I hope everything is how it is supposed to be and I hope that it is all clear. If there are any questions feel free to contact me on slack.

The possible commands are:

--display 

--buy

--sell (item and quantity in that order, example: Melon 5)

--revenue (date in the format of y m d: example 2023-11-24)

--advance-time 

--revenue_over_time
